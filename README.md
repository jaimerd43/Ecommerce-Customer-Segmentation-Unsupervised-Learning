E-commerce customer segmentation.
==============================

The aim of this project is to strategically segment the customers of an e-commerce platform specializing in the sale of all-occasion. Using exploratory data analysis techniques in Tableau, it will be uncovered some underlying customer patterns and profiles. Cluster analysis through R will define distinct customer segments based on transactional behaviour, complemented by LDA. The project will ultimately employ RFM analysis to further segment the customers.
